## About
e-Koolikott is a referatory for learning objects. Supporting simple and advanced search, it provides information such as the name, description, connection to Estonian national curricula, reviews and hyperlinks (metadata) to learning objects in content repositories and other sites.

Since catalogued learning objects are hosted externally, the aim is to provide embedded view where possible. Learning objects can be commented on and recommended for other users, or combined into simple shareable collections with an optional log in via Estonian national authentication methods or e-diary accounts.

Information about learning objects is gathered automatically from supported OER and commercial repositories using OAI-PMH protocol or added manually by authenticated users. For convenience, adding materials directly to Estonian state OER repository is also supported.
